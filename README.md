This is the cheatsheat for MA2101 Midterm test, 2022/23 Sem 1, taught by Prof Deqi Zhang. 

## Contributing

Please write the notes for respective chapters in the relative files. The chapter numbering follows Prof Zhang's notes. 

If you were to use itemize or enumerate, please remember to include the following setting:

```latex
\begin{enumerate}[noitemsep,nolistsep] % <- take note of here
    \item This is an item. 
\end{enumerate}
```

The philosophy is that we write down all the definitions, theorems, and remarks first, and then can delete what is not necessary.

Common abbreviations are also appreciated for the sake of saving space. (Honestly I think 2 pieces of paper should be allowed, but we only have 1...)
